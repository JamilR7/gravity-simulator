# Simple Gravity Simulator
--------------------------

There are different modes that determine how the particles move which can be activated via keystrokes. Currently, there are two modes that can be combined, a mode for particles to fall to the ground and a mode for particles to be attracted towards each other to form cell-like structures.

F to make the particles fall to the floor<br/>T to make the particles gravitate towards each other

There is also 2D collision dynamics incorporated, particles will glow when a collision check is being computed.

I plan to add options to adjust particle properties and toggle more types of particle behaviour once I have optimised the algorithms.
